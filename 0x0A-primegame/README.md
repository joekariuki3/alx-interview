# Prime Game

Simulate a prime-removal game between Maria and Ben to determine the overall winner.

### Problem

Implement `isWinner(x, nums)` where `x` is the number of rounds and `nums` contains the upper bound for each round. Players alternate removing a prime `p` and all multiples of `p` from the set `{1..n}` until no moves remain. Return the name of the player with the most wins, or `None` on a tie.

### Usage

```bash
python3 main_0.py
```
