# Making Change

Given coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given total.

### Problem

Implement `makeChange(coins, total) -> int` returning the minimal number of coins, or `-1` if the total cannot be met.

Two variants are included:

- `0-making_change.py` — greedy approach
- `0-making_change.py.mine` — dynamic programming (canonical solution)

### Usage

```bash
python3 0-main.py
```
